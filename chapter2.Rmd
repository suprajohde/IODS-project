  * gender: male (M) or female (F)  
  * age: years  
  * attitude: global attitude toward statistics  
  * deep: mean value for questions that measure deep learning  
  * stra: mean value for questions that measure strategic learning  
  * surf:  mean value for questions that measure surface learning  
  * points: exam points
